# Syntaxy

**Syntaxy** is a simple syntax highlighter for programming languages, written in C#. The goal of this project is to be as modular as possible, enabling users to add support for any programming language they wish and create their own custom renderers.

### ⚠️ Project Status

This project is **nowhere near completion** and is **not recommended for use in production**. It is currently in the early stages of development, and many features, including rendering, have yet to be fully implemented.

### 🚀 Features

- **Parse Programming Languages Using Regex:**
  - Supports parsing different programming languages via regular expressions.
  - Easy to extend—add your own language parsing rules by defining custom regex patterns.

- **Rendering (Coming Soon):**
  - The rendering of parsed code is not yet implemented.
  - Custom renderers will be supported, allowing you to define your own logic for rendering the highlighted code.
  - Pre-made renderers (like rendering to HTML) will be available to facilitate common use cases.
